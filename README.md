> Don't get me wrong, I admire elegance and have an appreciation of the finer things in life. But to me, beauty lies in simplicity. 

dijam is a simple but elegant website which I build whilst I was at University, it uses a simple but beautiful layout, the use of colors and text make the website look crisp and professional. If you didnt noticed I called it dijam because my name is majid (reverse)

## Login Page
If your a new user and havent used the site before it creates cookies and uses them, and it uses sessions. If you have two pages open and you log out of open it will terminate the session so the second page will log out aswell. I use a MySQL database and the website prevent from SQL Injection (hacking)
