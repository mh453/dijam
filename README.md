"Don't get me wrong, I admire elegance and have an appreciation of the finer things in life. But to me, beauty lies in simplicity." - Mark Hyman

dijam is a simple but elegant website which I build whilst I was at University, it uses a simple but beautiful layout, the uses a colors and text make the website look crips and professional. If you didnt noticed I called it dijam because my name is majid (reverse).
